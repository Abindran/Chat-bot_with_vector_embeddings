# Chat-bot_with_vector_embeddings
This is a basic chatbot created for the purpose of exploring vector embeddings. In this project, I utilized OpenAI, DataStax's AstraDB, and Langchain.

To run this project, you will require the following:
1. An OpenAI Account (for embeddings and language model).
2. A DataStax Account (AstraDB - Apache Cassandra Database) as the vector database.


This is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from anyone interested in cloning and enhancing it.


Those interested in enhancing this project have the option to incorporate the open-source Chroma vector database as an alternative to DataStax's Astra DB.
